# owncloud_ynh
Owncloud package for YunoHost.

OwnCloud gives you freedom and control over your own data. A personal cloud which runs on your own server. With Owncloud you can synchronize your files over your devices.

The current version in this package is Owncloud 8.0.3 from owncloud.org (I check files are ok with the sha256 sum).
